    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Upon arriving on the bustling streets, you'll find yourself beset upon by heaven's various monstrosities. There is nothing to collect or seek out in this level, so don't worry about exploration. Simply fight all enemies you come to and get the hang of the controls.
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">     

        <p>
            Take out the first wave of enemies by simply pressing SWORD ATTACK and using the finishing moves the game advises you by pressing ACTION. Soon, a more formidable foe will appear. Activate Chaos Form for the first time using the controls the game shows you. In this form, you deal a huge amount of damage and cannot be harmed -- not bad!
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            The Chaos Form has limited use, however, and you must wait for your gauge to refill after using it. For now, continue to follow the path shown on your map -- a yellow icon shows the way on your minimap.
            <br>
            <br>
            At various roadblocks, a squad of Angel Soldiers will confront you. The way forward will only be cleared once you eliminate every last one of them.
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            When you see a strange ooze bubble up on the side of a building, take note: this is Demonic Growth which you climb with ease. Climb this to the rooftops. Here, you'll be shown how to shimmy across ropes and pipes. Jump up and grab the rope and use it to cross to the next building.
            <br>
            As you ascend more Demonic Growth, fight off the enemies about you with regular attacks -- you can do this while hanging. You can also dash while hanging from Demonic growth to ascend faster by hitting DASH and pressing a direction.
        </p>

        
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            Keep pressing through the destroyed buildings and jump onto the zipline to return to the streets. Wind your way towards the northwest. You may have noticed a red boss icon (skull) has appeared on your minimap. Head straight for it!
        </p>

        <p class="bosstext">
            STRAGA
        </p>

        <p>
            The Straga's weak spot, its skull, lies atop the lofty beast. It's completely out of your sword's reach, so you'll need to find a creative way to bring it down. Stay towards the rear in this fight and make sure you lock on to Straga so the camera keeps it in view. There are several attacks you need to learn to avoid. One is a wave of fire, which is too fast to avoid by running. You'll need to dash out of the way. Plan to dash as soon as the demon recoils to attack.
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            Another attack has Straga lifting the street and shaking it. The conclusion of this attack is to slam it down and harm War. When Straga slams the street you need to jump to avoid damage.
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            The final of the attacks is one in which Straga tosses a fistful of automobiles right at you. These projectiles can be turned around and used against the colossus. Simply grab the car that lands in front of you and, while targeting Straga's head, toss it at his face. Do this twice and the beast will collapse, stunned.
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p>
            Approach it and slash away at its exposed skull while you can. You'll need to repeat this entire process three times to whittle away its life. Fell it a third time and you'll be able to execute your finishing move with the ACTIVATE button. A long cutscene follows...
        </p>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <p class="bosstext">
            THE CHARRED COUNCIL
        </p>

        <P>
            After the cutscene, head due east and grab your trusty blade: the Chaoseater, now stripped of its awesome power. It can still pull off a Blade Geyser attack at the expense of one Wrath Core, however.
        </P>

        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">
        <img class="contentimages" src="/Images/IGN_Winter_Doodle.png" alt="">

        <P>
            Now, head west to the blue fire. You will be awarded with 200 blue Currency Souls which you can spend on goodies later. After this, you'll be transported back to Earth -- a very different place than you may remember it.
        </P>
